## TODO
[ ] leak in radiant system in living room
  - fix leak
  - fix damaged hardwood

[ ] 4 windows are misaligned, leading to a visible air gap (lets insects and air come in)
  - one in kitchen
  - one in upstairs hallway
  - one in powder room
  - the window pains probably just need to be re-aligned within their frames
  - some windows are hard to close (baby room)

[ ] there is a gap in the windows in the master bedroom, either same misalignment as other windows or between window frame and house framing.
  - it is hidden behind the fir trims
  - gap was letting in flys
  - isolated the gap by blue taping a bunch of the trims, I will try to narrow down exactly under which trim the gap is
  > we might need to remove the trim anyway to install roller shades

[ ] garage door doesn't close fully on the left side
  - garage door only closes 1/3 tries, meets resistance and goes back up, looks like it is twisting
  > I contacted James, scheduled for Tuesday 22nd

[ ] garage has lots of gaps in it
[ ] door bell rings on its own
